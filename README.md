Centralised back-up systems (like dropbox and google+) have a single point of failure. If the company goes bankrupt your files can be gone.

That is why we created a fully distributed backup software. It started as a school project, but now it has a second life as an open source project.

A user manual can be found in the wiki. At the current moment, the project is not stable enough for day-to-day use.
